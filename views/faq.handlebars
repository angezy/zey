                                            <p>As professional home buyers, we don’t act as real estate agents and we
                                                don’t list houses. Instead, we purchase houses in the Central Florida
                                                area that meet our specific purchasing criteria.</p>
                                            <p>Once we buy your house, we may choose to repair it and resell it to
                                                another homeowner, keep it as a rental property, or sell it to a
                                                financial partner.</p>
                                            <p>Regardless of what we do with the property, you’ll receive the

                                            <p> We typically purchase houses at a discount to the top market value, as
                                                we need to resell them at a profit to another homeowner.<br>
                                                However, we always strive to provide a fair and reasonable price for the
                                                property we are purchasing.<br>

                                                We understand that many sellers need to sell their home quickly, and we
                                                are able to offer a quick and hassle-free cash sale, without requiring
                                                the seller to make any repairs or pay any agent fees.<br>

                                                If you are looking for a fast and easy sale, we are happy to work with
                                                you to find a price that works for both parties.<br>
                                                And of course, our no-obligation pricing commitment means that you are
                                                under no obligation to move forward with the offer we provide. </p>

                                                needed, and recent sales of comparable properties in the area.
